    <h1>History
2008â€“2010: Initial seasons
Main articles: Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008, 2009, and 2010
In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL) a Twenty20 competition set to begin in 2008.[6] On 24 January 2008, an auction was held in Mumbai for the league's teams, which represented eight different cities in India, including Bengaluru. The Bangalore franchise was acquired by Vijay Mallya for US$111.6 million, making it the second-highest bid, slightly less than Reliance Industries' US$111.9 million bid for the Mumbai Indians.[7]


Rahul Dravid was the team's icon player in 2008.
Ahead of the 2008 player auction, the IPL designated Rahul Dravid as the icon player for the Bangalore franchise. This designation ensured that Dravid would be paid 15% more than the highest bid player at the auction.[8] The franchise acquired several prominent Indian and international players, including Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn, and Cameron White.[9] In the second round of the auction, they also signed Ross Taylor, Misbah-ul-Haq, and India under-19 World Cup-winning captain Virat Kohli.[10] The franchise named Dravid as the captain of the team and appointed Venkatesh Prasad as the head coach.[11] The team struggled in the inaugural season, winning only four out of their 14 matches and finishing seventh in the eight-team table.[12] Dravid was the sole player to score more than 300 runs in the tournament, and the team even had to bench their most expensive foreign player, Kallis, for several matches due to his poor form.[13][14] Midway through the season, the string of failures led to the sacking of CEO Charu Sharma, who was replaced by Brijesh Patel. Mallya publicly criticised Dravid and Sharma for their selection of players at the auction, stating that his "biggest mistake was to abstain from the selection of the team."[15] Eventually, the chief cricketing officer of the franchise, Martin Crowe, resigned and Prasad was replaced by Ray Jennings as the head coach.[16]</h1>
